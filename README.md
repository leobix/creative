# Creative: Generative AI for Creative Problem Solving

Can cutting-edge AI models help us develop innovative solutions for a circular economy? This project explores how GPT-4 can be used for generating diverse and creative business ideas that promote sustainability.

** Key Insights From Code **

The Power of Prompt Engineering: Discover how different prompt engineering strategies influence the quality and relevance of GPT-4's output.
Fighting Idea Homogeneity: Experiment with two configurations designed to maximize diversity in the ideas generated:
Multiple-Instance Solutions: See how different instances of GPT-4 tackle the same problem, each providing a unique perspective.
Differentiated Single-Instance Solutions: Guide a single GPT-4 instance to explore a broader range of solutions with instructions that encourage variation.
